The GWAS summary statistics corresponding to @cad_ng_2015 are provided by the [Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAM) plus The Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) consortium](http://www.cardiogramplusc4d.org/data-downloads/).

Below is the basic information about these datasets (excerpt from the download page of CARDIoGRAMplusC4D website).

```
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes-based GWAS is a meta-analysis of GWAS studies of mainly European, South Asian, and East Asian, descent imputed using the 1000 Genomes phase 1 v3 training set with 38 million variants. The study interrogated 9.4 million variants and involved 60,801 CAD cases and 123,504 controls. Data as published in: CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium, M Nikpey, A Goel, H Won, LM Hall C. Willenborg, S Kanoni, D Saleheen et al. A comprehensive 1000 Genomesâ€“based genome-wide association meta-analysis of coronary artery disease. Nat Genet 2015 47:1121-1130.

Markername, chr, bp_hg19, effect_allele, noneffect_allele, effect_allele_freq, median_info, model, beta, se_dgc, p_dgc, het_pvalue, n_studies. The 3 results files correspond to (i) all cases analysed with an additive model, (ii) all cases analysed with a recessive model, and (iii) all MI cases with an additive model.

In the C4D GWA meta-analysis and the 1000 Genomes-based GWAS meta-analyses adjustment was for study-specific covariates only.

median_info: Median imputation quality based on all particiapting studies
model: fixed/random effects
se_dgc: standard error (double genomic controlled)
p_dgc: Association p-value based on beta & se_dgc
het_pvalue: Heterogeneity p-value
