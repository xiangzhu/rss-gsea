The GWAS summary statistics corresponding to @azh_ng_2013 are provided by the [International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP)](http://web.pasteur-lille.fr/en/recherche/u744/igap/igap_download.php).

Below is the basic information about these datasets (excerpt from the download page of IGAP).

```
Two dataset are provided. The first one corresponds to the meta-analysis results obtained in stage 1 including genotyped and imputed data (7,055,881 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1000G phase 1 alpha imputation, Build 37, Assembly Hg19) of 17,008 Alzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls. The second one corresponds to the meta-analysis results of the 11,632 SNPs that were genotyped and tested for association in an independent set of 8,572 Alzheimer's disease cases and 11,312 controls with the combined stage1/stage2 P-values.

Each file consists of the following information for each SNP and its association to Alzheimer's disease based on meta-analysis in the publication mentioned below. Although the individual datasets examined excluded any SNPs with call rates <95%, IGAP meta-analysis only analyzed SNPs either genotyped or successfully imputed in at least 40% of the AD cases and 40 % of the control samples across all datasets.

    Chromosome: Chromosome of the SNP (Build 37, Assembly Hg19)
    Position: Position of the SNP (Build 37, Assembly Hg19)
    MarkerName: SNP rsID or chromosome:position if rsID not available
    Effect_allele: Reference allele (coded allele)
    Non_Effect_allele: Non reference allele (non coded allele)
    Beta: Overall estimated effect size for the effect allele
    SE: Overall standard error for effect size estimate
    Pvalue: Meta-analysis Pvalue using regression coefficients (beta and standard error)
```

We only use the data from stage 1 in our analyses.

The following analyses have been performed on Alzheimer's Disease 2013 dataset.
