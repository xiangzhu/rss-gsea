# Basic Information

**Who**

[Xiang Zhu][xzhu] is a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago.

[xzhu]: https://github.com/xiangzhu

**What**

The aim of this project is to develop statistical methods for integrated enrichment analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data and biological pathways.
Specifically, I combine the likelihood function from @rss_2016 with the prior distribution from @integrated_plos_2013, and then perform Bayesian analysis. 

To learn more about other research projects, visit the [lab website](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu).

**How**

I made this notebook using many wonderful publicly available tools.
I write the analyses using [R Markdown][rmarkdown], [knitr][], [bookdown][] and [pandoc][].
This notebook is motivated by the idea from [singleCellseq][scs].
To host the notebook, I use [GitHub Pages][gh-pages].
