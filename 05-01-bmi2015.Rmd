The GWAS summary statistics corresponding to @bmi_na_2015 are provided by the [Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files#GWAS_Anthropometric_2015_BMI).

Below is the basic information about these datasets (excerpt from the download page of GIANT website).
```
Each file consists of the following information for each SNP and its association to the specified trait based on meta-analysis in the respective publication. Significant digits for the p values, betas and standard errors are limited to two digits to further limit the possibility of identifiability.

    MarkerName: The dbSNP name of the genetic marker
    Allele1: The first allele (hg19 + strand). Where the regression coefficients (betas) are provided, the first allele is the effect allele. Where betas are not provided (typically the 2010 data), the first allele is the trait-increasing allele.
    Allele2: The second allele (hg19 + strand)
    Freq.Allele1.HapMapCEU: The allele frequency of Allele1 in the HapMap CEU population
    b: beta
    SE: standard error
    p: p-value after meta-analysis using regression coefficients (beta and standard error), and after correction for inflation of test statistics using genomic control both at the individual study level and again after meta-analysis
    N: Number of observations
