What This is my online notebook for sharing large-scale analysis results1 from a research project, the aim of which is to develop statistical methods for integrated enrichment analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data and biological pathways or tissue-based gene sets. How I make this notebook using many wonderful publicly available tools, including rmarkdown, knitr, bookdown, pandoc and DT. This notebook is largely motivated by the idea from the singleCellseq project at the Gilad Lab. To host the notebook, I use GitHub Pages.

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 52 sets of (h,theta0) under null.
