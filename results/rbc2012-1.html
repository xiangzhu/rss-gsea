<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.1.1</span> Fit the null model</h3>
<p>I used the grids <code>theta0=(-5:0.25:-2)'</code> and <code>h=(0.3:0.1:0.6)'</code> when fitting the null model. I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 52 sets of <code>(h,theta0)</code> under null.</p>
<p><img src="images/rbc2012_null_round1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (<code>logw.step*</code>) to posterior probabilities (<code>posp.step*</code>), we can see that almost 100% posterior mass is concentrated on the settings <code>h=[0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6]</code> and <code>theta0 = -3.5</code>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.1.2</span> Fit the enrichment model</h3>
<p>To perform GSEA, I set <code>h=[0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6]</code> and <code>theta0 = -3.5</code>, since the null analysis suggests that almost 100% posterior mass is placed on these settings. For the log-fold enrichment parameter, I use the grid <code>theta = (0:(3.5/50):3.5)'</code>. The following table lists the GSEA results.</p>

<p>To help decide the grid for <code>theta</code> in Round 2 enrichment analysis (Section <a href="rbc2012-2.html#rbc2012-2">17.2</a>), I looked at the posterior mean, 95% lower and upper bound of <code>theta</code> for the top 100 enriched pathways identified in Round 1 analysis.</p>
