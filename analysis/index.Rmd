## Overview

This is my online notebook to document and share the full results
of genome-wide enrichment analyses described in the manuscript:

> Xiang Zhu and Matthew Stephens (2017). A large-scale genome-wide enrichment analysis identifies new trait-associated genes, pathways and tissues across 31 human phenotypes. *bioRxiv.* [https://doi.org/10.1101/160770](https://doi.org/10.1101/160770).

The software that was used to generate these results is available at
https://github.com/stephenslab/rss/tree/master/src_vb.
Here is an [example](http://stephenslab.github.io/rss/Example-5)
illustrating how to use this software in enrichment analyses of GWAS summary statistics.

If you find results shown in this notebook and/or
methods implemented in the software useful for your work,
please cite the manuscript listed above,
[Zhu and Stephens (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1101/160770).

If you have any question about this notebook or the software, please feel free to contact me:
[Xiang Zhu](https://github.com/xiangzhu), `xiangzhu@uchicago.edu` or `xiangzhu@stanford.edu`.
