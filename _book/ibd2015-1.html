<p>I used the grids <code>theta0=(-4:0.25:-2)'</code> and <code>h=(0.3:0.1:0.6)'</code> when fitting the null model. I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 36 sets of <code>(h,theta0)</code> under null.</p>
<p><img src="images/ibd2015_null_round1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (<code>logw.step*</code>) to posterior probabilities (<code>posp.step*</code>), we can see that almost 99.9% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting <code>(h=0.3, theta0=-3)</code>.</p>
