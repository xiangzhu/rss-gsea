What This is my notebook for a research project. The aim of this project is to develop statistical methods for integrated enrichment analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data and biological pathways. Specifically, I combine the likelihood function from Zhu and Stephens (2016) with the prior distribution from Carbonetto and Stephens (2013), and then perform Bayesian analysis. To learn more about other research projects, please visit the Stephens Lab website. How I make this notebook using many wonderful publicly available tools, including rarkdown, knitr, bookdown and pandoc. This notebook is largely motivated by the idea from the singleCellseq project at the Gilad Lab. To host the notebook, I use GitHub Pages.  1.1 License Currently the notebook is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-ND 4.0).
