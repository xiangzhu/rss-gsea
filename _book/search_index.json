What This is my notebook for a research project, the aim of which is to develop statistical methods for integrated enrichment analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data and biological pathways. Specifically, I combine the likelihood function from Zhu and Stephens (2016) with the prior distribution from Carbonetto and Stephens (2013), and then perform Bayesian analysis. How I make this notebook using many wonderful publicly available tools, including rmarkdown, knitr, bookdown and pandoc. This notebook is largely motivated by the idea from the singleCellseq project at the Gilad Lab. To host the notebook, I use GitHub Pages.

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 52 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 100% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-2).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[15772.716214539,15865.1959805549,15942.0035483472,16504.0546748302,17214.9350493929,17502.5464035457,18131.2587718363,18571.893694898,18768.0005414594,18499.455770243,17632.5016308921,16346.7705571135,14985.4430855718,15595.0266580057,16060.7512869509,16164.3941185893,16773.3883163228,17433.6433729187,17661.8128803409,18233.6012026087,18629.7696814634,18743.9334029892,18386.4293393935,17282.5633574676,15537.6295269885,13483.31,15646.7219762444,16217.7345435329,16357.987825491,16959.7761691632,17640.7351785243,17766.4255951377,18287.5099996301,18573.592238444,18618.8049755769,18190.8397339535,16848.7666814782,14618.9260693723,11832.6014953093,15661.4661997577,16333.9716303039,16501.741570159,17089.2613757446,17805.3855875165,17861.9219659438,18355.4914435009,18531.1083591368,18483.6199194833,17932.3617750899,16392.5840352386,13707.3652063418,10189.48],[15783.8311799562,15859.6692789145,15936.4115468656,16512.7151440309,17214.4809420998,17501.9096385513,18131.2587718363,18573.7746506355,18763.0129370975,18497.4680224442,17632.501630892,16346.7705571134,14985.4430855717,15600.2789413014,16065.1890319215,16165.9351723838,16773.3883163225,17429.5431178822,17660.9192711787,18235.3637645069,18631.8292366205,18743.9334029915,18386.3240508614,17282.5633574676,15537.6295269884,13483.31,15646.7219762445,16213.0497585754,16358.7890026916,16965.0577547549,17640.7351785082,17766.4255951378,18287.6931405376,18575.7675454416,18616.4691786283,18190.8397339568,16848.7666814782,14618.9260693722,11832.6014953092,15661.4661997579,16332.7609545679,16501.7415701589,17257.8006311462,17805.3855875064,17861.9219659558,18355.4514518252,18532.5556845155,18483.6199194825,17932.3617750899,16392.5840352387,13707.3652063413,10189.48],[0,0,0,0,0,0,2.927945949697e-277,6.79013915878097e-86,0.9999999999647,2.35769551162593e-117,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.19060541911198e-233,9.270438453697e-61,3.52999887627071e-11,1.93077865743035e-166,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.1164551843477e-209,3.71147691969632e-85,1.60394330369321e-65,2.1991058271424e-251,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.07253363816971e-180,1.31532299065915e-103,3.1265481079628e-124,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,4.29192481419751e-275,6.52914663708757e-83,0.999999994825557,4.73487879597421e-116,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.99642142117754e-230,1.06571913820136e-57,5.17444313047929e-09,2.54738924630759e-164,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.72593446969964e-207,4.79026610619685e-82,2.27433448873276e-64,3.22355571496549e-249,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.96083870583704e-178,8.19760308790579e-101,4.58304546132988e-122,0,0,0,0]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 52 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 99.4% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-2).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[648.949025942608,785.497272033671,947.004775124127,1137.20889374272,1378.55714719127,1620.48581382914,1840.47304830139,2001.69347097676,2006.7971648273,1866.92583808855,1605.7531265752,1264.21979037489,892.215682412689,615.188290965787,746.163761666514,892.763036258308,1061.68744907942,1267.2417872289,1463.69069992607,1626.63604867092,1710.92540723119,1582.45102235572,1222.12672981,646.512271811618,-92.4740300698591,-884.634234424087,593.068747832936,715.381112467909,843.060048113159,1005.31739562481,1174.20459124396,1337.67489428404,1441.62296044374,1441.26193669176,1205.80112521106,637.63044672003,-264.085219131314,-1431.6862982686,-2720.10576780253,578.636421341971,694.51388812695,808.765498133676,957.754686707163,1104.82002786247,1237.2316763692,1282.75648602704,1218.36824845135,868.594626557146,109.422035550252,-1096.68758160259,-2701.40943677536,-4522.98279279117],[648.94902594261,785.497272033669,947.004775124125,1137.20889374272,1378.55714719125,1620.48581382914,1840.47304830139,2001.69347097672,2006.79716482731,1866.92583808854,1605.75312657523,1264.21979037492,892.215682412675,615.18829096582,746.163761666516,892.763036258487,1061.68744907942,1267.2417872289,1463.6906999262,1626.63604867091,1710.92540723121,1582.4510223558,1222.12672980917,646.512271811623,-92.4740300698477,-884.634234424002,593.068747832897,715.381112467942,843.060048113093,1005.31739562481,1174.20459124397,1337.67489428433,1441.62296044373,1441.26193669171,1205.80112521106,637.630446719899,-264.085219131309,-1431.68629826864,-2720.10576780252,578.636421341926,694.513888126926,808.765498133704,957.754686707163,1104.82002786247,1237.2316763692,1282.75648602682,1218.36824845135,868.594626557148,109.422035550247,-1096.68758160254,-2701.40943677539,-4522.98279279117],[0,0,0,0,1.43283766299023e-273,1.67680254212345e-168,5.80395376547679e-73,0.00603759367752859,0.993962406322471,1.78658868721837e-61,6.70127045262694e-175,2.96439387504748e-323,0,0,0,0,0,6.47225996052033e-322,1.34657071794788e-236,7.86131100440241e-166,3.17613010146694e-129,5.08372285509379e-185,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.51918547322138e-291,3.51019853773819e-246,2.44647655189058e-246,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.55220877362649e-315,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,1.43283766295158e-273,1.67680254210833e-168,5.8039537654456e-73,0.00603759367722158,0.993962406322778,1.78658868718115e-61,6.70127045277224e-175,2.96439387504748e-323,0,0,0,0,0,6.47225996052033e-322,1.34657071811608e-236,7.86131100433334e-166,3.17613010151125e-129,5.08372285544213e-185,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.51918547395247e-291,3.51019853767383e-246,2.44647655175115e-246,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.55220876868583e-315,0,0,0,0,0,0]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 68 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 99.6% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-4).

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 36 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 99.9% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-3).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[939.831203926311,981.20521734351,1027.79041845949,1076.92572851571,1121.84812461721,1114.59076011155,1077.86991990982,1002.2281445395,919.389930060929,924.491937659882,964.045419827819,998.46658076326,1052.39479242587,1065.24907237929,1073.70598215676,1024.24137757124,929.643920603112,828.820691865791,920.430998055655,949.319660004268,986.96054828668,1018.78563851202,1031.19014973821,1027.2485570492,957.626149920933,840.800884926778,700.934990519201,911.090139275655,937.621244327116,965.278491141796,1001.59254977959,998.155469737391,976.285917557678,891.502594847281,746.962235111595,554.496633681],[949.783415655399,981.20521734351,1027.79041845949,1076.92572851585,1121.84812461722,1114.59076011165,1077.86991990971,1002.22814454011,919.38993006094,934.269887331074,964.045419827848,1006.99532039557,1052.39479242587,1065.24907237927,1074.97936293531,1024.24137757097,929.643920603134,828.256476983827,920.430998055605,949.319660004265,986.960548286684,1018.78563851202,1031.19014973821,1027.24855704916,960.14871096067,840.800884926673,700.934990519214,911.09013927586,937.621244327116,965.278491141795,1001.59254977959,998.15546973739,976.285917557715,891.502594847262,746.96223511164,554.092988463841],[8.92790739782884e-80,8.30338926625685e-62,1.41563464072444e-41,3.09132883833216e-20,0.999295533106625,0.000704466893374987,7.94698361636776e-20,1.12046081519949e-52,1.18363346144285e-88,1.94531968301761e-86,2.92988130524158e-69,2.60477539974954e-54,6.86270017854338e-31,2.62444743199926e-25,1.23545556089001e-21,4.07026145776332e-43,3.36100179313626e-84,5.48904581744973e-128,3.35233429203591e-88,1.17905426461762e-75,2.62279210948776e-59,1.73870114206153e-45,4.24068208587517e-40,8.23424454719488e-42,4.77525456306267e-72,8.75847701141591e-123,1.58285979017423e-183,2.94214379838854e-92,9.79436800664098e-81,1.00546300110051e-68,5.93418902493626e-53,1.90834319169595e-54,6.06499778351162e-64,9.16012575518216e-101,1.5446169290861e-163,4.00011182977511e-247],[1.87473684001866e-75,8.30338926614397e-62,1.41563464070214e-41,3.09132883872276e-20,0.999295533106559,0.000704466893440614,7.94698361537162e-20,1.12046081587441e-52,1.18363346143941e-88,3.43163088281886e-82,2.92988130528702e-69,1.31751279492269e-50,6.86270017845087e-31,2.62444743189944e-25,4.41417324397725e-21,4.07026145661547e-43,3.36100179316432e-84,3.12220522392562e-128,3.35233429182112e-88,1.17905426459771e-75,2.62279210946284e-59,1.73870114202544e-45,4.24068208581511e-40,8.2342445467581e-42,5.95019047039761e-71,8.7584770103748e-123,1.58285979017233e-183,2.94214379894961e-92,9.79436800650561e-81,1.00546300108512e-68,5.93418902485423e-53,1.90834319166719e-54,6.06499778365258e-64,9.16012575488476e-101,1.54461692913552e-163,2.67159881683213e-247]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?
