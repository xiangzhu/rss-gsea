What This is my notebook for a research project, the aim of which is to develop statistical methods for integrated enrichment analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data and biological pathways. Specifically, I combine the likelihood function from Zhu and Stephens (2016) with the prior distribution from Carbonetto and Stephens (2013), and then perform Bayesian analysis. How I make this notebook using many wonderful publicly available tools, including rmarkdown, knitr, bookdown and pandoc. This notebook is largely motivated by the idea from the singleCellseq project at the Gilad Lab. To host the notebook, I use GitHub Pages. Contact If you have any question about this notebook, please feel free to contact me. Create a new issue in GitHub. Send an email to xiangzhu@uchicago.edu. References "],
