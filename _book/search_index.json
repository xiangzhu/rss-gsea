What This is my notebook for a research project, the aim of which is to develop statistical methods for integrated enrichment analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data and biological pathways. Specifically, I combine the likelihood function from Zhu and Stephens (2016) with the prior distribution from Carbonetto and Stephens (2013), and then perform Bayesian analysis. How I make this notebook using many wonderful publicly available tools, including rmarkdown, knitr, bookdown and pandoc. This notebook is largely motivated by the idea from the singleCellseq project at the Gilad Lab. To host the notebook, I use GitHub Pages.

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 52 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 100% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-2).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[15772.716214539,15865.1959805549,15942.0035483472,16504.0546748302,17214.9350493929,17502.5464035457,18131.2587718363,18571.893694898,18768.0005414594,18499.455770243,17632.5016308921,16346.7705571135,14985.4430855718,15595.0266580057,16060.7512869509,16164.3941185893,16773.3883163228,17433.6433729187,17661.8128803409,18233.6012026087,18629.7696814634,18743.9334029892,18386.4293393935,17282.5633574676,15537.6295269885,13483.31,15646.7219762444,16217.7345435329,16357.987825491,16959.7761691632,17640.7351785243,17766.4255951377,18287.5099996301,18573.592238444,18618.8049755769,18190.8397339535,16848.7666814782,14618.9260693723,11832.6014953093,15661.4661997577,16333.9716303039,16501.741570159,17089.2613757446,17805.3855875165,17861.9219659438,18355.4914435009,18531.1083591368,18483.6199194833,17932.3617750899,16392.5840352386,13707.3652063418,10189.48],[15783.8311799562,15859.6692789145,15936.4115468656,16512.7151440309,17214.4809420998,17501.9096385513,18131.2587718363,18573.7746506355,18763.0129370975,18497.4680224442,17632.501630892,16346.7705571134,14985.4430855717,15600.2789413014,16065.1890319215,16165.9351723838,16773.3883163225,17429.5431178822,17660.9192711787,18235.3637645069,18631.8292366205,18743.9334029915,18386.3240508614,17282.5633574676,15537.6295269884,13483.31,15646.7219762445,16213.0497585754,16358.7890026916,16965.0577547549,17640.7351785082,17766.4255951378,18287.6931405376,18575.7675454416,18616.4691786283,18190.8397339568,16848.7666814782,14618.9260693722,11832.6014953092,15661.4661997579,16332.7609545679,16501.7415701589,17257.8006311462,17805.3855875064,17861.9219659558,18355.4514518252,18532.5556845155,18483.6199194825,17932.3617750899,16392.5840352387,13707.3652063413,10189.48],[0,0,0,0,0,0,2.927945949697e-277,6.79013915878097e-86,0.9999999999647,2.35769551162593e-117,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.19060541911198e-233,9.270438453697e-61,3.52999887627071e-11,1.93077865743035e-166,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.1164551843477e-209,3.71147691969632e-85,1.60394330369321e-65,2.1991058271424e-251,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.07253363816971e-180,1.31532299065915e-103,3.1265481079628e-124,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,4.29192481419751e-275,6.52914663708757e-83,0.999999994825557,4.73487879597421e-116,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.99642142117754e-230,1.06571913820136e-57,5.17444313047929e-09,2.54738924630759e-164,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.72593446969964e-207,4.79026610619685e-82,2.27433448873276e-64,3.22355571496549e-249,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.96083870583704e-178,8.19760308790579e-101,4.58304546132988e-122,0,0,0,0]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 52 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 99.4% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-2).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-1.75,-1.5,-1.25,-1],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[648.949025942608,785.497272033671,947.004775124127,1137.20889374272,1378.55714719127,1620.48581382914,1840.47304830139,2001.69347097676,2006.7971648273,1866.92583808855,1605.7531265752,1264.21979037489,892.215682412689,615.188290965787,746.163761666514,892.763036258308,1061.68744907942,1267.2417872289,1463.69069992607,1626.63604867092,1710.92540723119,1582.45102235572,1222.12672981,646.512271811618,-92.4740300698591,-884.634234424087,593.068747832936,715.381112467909,843.060048113159,1005.31739562481,1174.20459124396,1337.67489428404,1441.62296044374,1441.26193669176,1205.80112521106,637.63044672003,-264.085219131314,-1431.6862982686,-2720.10576780253,578.636421341971,694.51388812695,808.765498133676,957.754686707163,1104.82002786247,1237.2316763692,1282.75648602704,1218.36824845135,868.594626557146,109.422035550252,-1096.68758160259,-2701.40943677536,-4522.98279279117],[648.94902594261,785.497272033669,947.004775124125,1137.20889374272,1378.55714719125,1620.48581382914,1840.47304830139,2001.69347097672,2006.79716482731,1866.92583808854,1605.75312657523,1264.21979037492,892.215682412675,615.18829096582,746.163761666516,892.763036258487,1061.68744907942,1267.2417872289,1463.6906999262,1626.63604867091,1710.92540723121,1582.4510223558,1222.12672980917,646.512271811623,-92.4740300698477,-884.634234424002,593.068747832897,715.381112467942,843.060048113093,1005.31739562481,1174.20459124397,1337.67489428433,1441.62296044373,1441.26193669171,1205.80112521106,637.630446719899,-264.085219131309,-1431.68629826864,-2720.10576780252,578.636421341926,694.513888126926,808.765498133704,957.754686707163,1104.82002786247,1237.2316763692,1282.75648602682,1218.36824845135,868.594626557148,109.422035550247,-1096.68758160254,-2701.40943677539,-4522.98279279117],[0,0,0,0,1.43283766299023e-273,1.67680254212345e-168,5.80395376547679e-73,0.00603759367752859,0.993962406322471,1.78658868721837e-61,6.70127045262694e-175,2.96439387504748e-323,0,0,0,0,0,6.47225996052033e-322,1.34657071794788e-236,7.86131100440241e-166,3.17613010146694e-129,5.08372285509379e-185,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.51918547322138e-291,3.51019853773819e-246,2.44647655189058e-246,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.55220877362649e-315,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,1.43283766295158e-273,1.67680254210833e-168,5.8039537654456e-73,0.00603759367722158,0.993962406322778,1.78658868718115e-61,6.70127045277224e-175,2.96439387504748e-323,0,0,0,0,0,6.47225996052033e-322,1.34657071811608e-236,7.86131100433334e-166,3.17613010151125e-129,5.08372285544213e-185,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.51918547395247e-291,3.51019853767383e-246,2.44647655175115e-246,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.55220876868583e-315,0,0,0,0,0,0]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 68 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 99.6% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-4).

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 36 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 99.9% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-3).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[939.831203926311,981.20521734351,1027.79041845949,1076.92572851571,1121.84812461721,1114.59076011155,1077.86991990982,1002.2281445395,919.389930060929,924.491937659882,964.045419827819,998.46658076326,1052.39479242587,1065.24907237929,1073.70598215676,1024.24137757124,929.643920603112,828.820691865791,920.430998055655,949.319660004268,986.96054828668,1018.78563851202,1031.19014973821,1027.2485570492,957.626149920933,840.800884926778,700.934990519201,911.090139275655,937.621244327116,965.278491141796,1001.59254977959,998.155469737391,976.285917557678,891.502594847281,746.962235111595,554.496633681],[949.783415655399,981.20521734351,1027.79041845949,1076.92572851585,1121.84812461722,1114.59076011165,1077.86991990971,1002.22814454011,919.38993006094,934.269887331074,964.045419827848,1006.99532039557,1052.39479242587,1065.24907237927,1074.97936293531,1024.24137757097,929.643920603134,828.256476983827,920.430998055605,949.319660004265,986.960548286684,1018.78563851202,1031.19014973821,1027.24855704916,960.14871096067,840.800884926673,700.934990519214,911.09013927586,937.621244327116,965.278491141795,1001.59254977959,998.15546973739,976.285917557715,891.502594847262,746.96223511164,554.092988463841],[8.92790739782884e-80,8.30338926625685e-62,1.41563464072444e-41,3.09132883833216e-20,0.999295533106625,0.000704466893374987,7.94698361636776e-20,1.12046081519949e-52,1.18363346144285e-88,1.94531968301761e-86,2.92988130524158e-69,2.60477539974954e-54,6.86270017854338e-31,2.62444743199926e-25,1.23545556089001e-21,4.07026145776332e-43,3.36100179313626e-84,5.48904581744973e-128,3.35233429203591e-88,1.17905426461762e-75,2.62279210948776e-59,1.73870114206153e-45,4.24068208587517e-40,8.23424454719488e-42,4.77525456306267e-72,8.75847701141591e-123,1.58285979017423e-183,2.94214379838854e-92,9.79436800664098e-81,1.00546300110051e-68,5.93418902493626e-53,1.90834319169595e-54,6.06499778351162e-64,9.16012575518216e-101,1.5446169290861e-163,4.00011182977511e-247],[1.87473684001866e-75,8.30338926614397e-62,1.41563464070214e-41,3.09132883872276e-20,0.999295533106559,0.000704466893440614,7.94698361537162e-20,1.12046081587441e-52,1.18363346143941e-88,3.43163088281886e-82,2.92988130528702e-69,1.31751279492269e-50,6.86270017845087e-31,2.62444743189944e-25,4.41417324397725e-21,4.07026145661547e-43,3.36100179316432e-84,3.12220522392562e-128,3.35233429182112e-88,1.17905426459771e-75,2.62279210946284e-59,1.73870114202544e-45,4.24068208581511e-40,8.2342445467581e-42,5.95019047039761e-71,8.7584770103748e-123,1.58285979017233e-183,2.94214379894961e-92,9.79436800650561e-81,1.00546300108512e-68,5.93418902485423e-53,1.90834319166719e-54,6.06499778365258e-64,9.16012575488476e-101,1.54461692913552e-163,2.67159881683213e-247]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 36 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 99.8 % posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-4).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-5,-4.75,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-5,-4.75,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-5,-4.75,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-5,-4.75,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[457.371801422267,489.55871476139,509.732948792762,517.674737653198,524.8397420264,518.606996526398,506.774936083834,424.081682643961,276.574545064862,25.0037026065736,-375.372990014421,-963.456134662746,-1787.96429669946,452.40634284995,483.614143220485,502.92698953948,510.742622549946,505.051325344752,505.340905032815,484.285144352971,388.162827030972,215.692381111462,-79.7948780360551,-557.08372165606,-1284.95522038064,-2325.64723191382,448.640052706259,479.433498486456,499.549810305943,504.503289512612,497.166509414645,493.873213656684,467.507205282438,359.09333659546,170.747731370491,-160.297714569061,-705.6569699503,-1540.93820870762,-2762.53326124589,449.756040126091,475.725825122693,496.036676711136,499.793954455164,490.825231238148,484.095559459478,454.284512362301,338.402039114838,136.423645732117,-222.467995615595,-814.461779524843,-1743.41122447796,-3118.28520912323],[463.681955435143,487.167514525765,508.304692272455,516.960962946265,524.839742026439,518.092995272515,506.774936083833,431.152245944191,277.939696039441,25.1209404896227,-376.472422665583,-970.057974785631,-1787.96429669932,459.845365087619,481.153974584212,502.926989539495,510.508058765871,514.140411830677,504.829440861445,484.285144352905,395.779863252893,216.471829263977,-79.5640838097254,-557.57863789511,-1284.86311285182,-2326.23325813641,448.640052706261,476.973871194881,499.549810305943,504.503289512804,497.166509414648,493.873213656666,467.507205282438,367.275286073008,171.509125885964,-160.053707389708,-698.111855754213,-1540.78542153883,-2764.24787888706,449.756040126092,473.26659888177,496.036676711137,499.518270734538,490.825231238148,485.719190206387,454.284512362355,346.107468260203,135.355319660647,-222.214817840862,-807.13089967619,-1743.23928310948,-3118.2852091233],[4.98721505450515e-30,4.74741227725026e-16,2.74167179990485e-07,0.000771064207054727,0.997269198407324,0.00195868874547611,1.42353080005808e-08,1.73837396297172e-44,1.50871537663092e-108,8.37102481305646e-218,0,0,0,3.47845859199064e-32,1.24383373387732e-18,3.03546281656269e-10,7.52508147238443e-07,2.53987436768243e-09,3.39293153173403e-09,2.43318102103053e-18,4.37302962608367e-60,5.46788617581699e-135,2.56645317444823e-263,0,0,0,8.04836773170541e-34,1.90165352288205e-20,1.0364171999659e-11,1.46826111572857e-09,9.56049075675094e-13,3.54993181111861e-14,1.25778978762152e-25,1.03767924825023e-72,1.65426884901336e-154,2.80153247435758e-298,0,0,0,2.45682933760134e-33,4.66561941703762e-22,3.08887317656837e-13,1.32301591516715e-11,1.68460492363153e-15,2.01297669619649e-18,2.27544054926174e-31,1.071388085517e-81,2.05043073287459e-169,0,0,0,0],[2.74679706746538e-27,4.34986013115859e-17,6.58013722886118e-08,0.00037809900843209,0.998425850876271,0.00117284583803567,1.42518183907512e-08,2.04810984523969e-41,5.9154564753845e-108,9.42318692838244e-218,0,0,0,5.92402056937136e-29,1.06372184754423e-19,3.03898340608246e-10,5.95860862113173e-07,2.25245307935831e-05,2.03681901103737e-09,2.43600307207274e-18,8.89861936980574e-57,1.1935288144751e-134,3.23645382475695e-263,0,0,0,8.05770238691362e-34,1.62716743290591e-21,1.037619257018e-11,1.46996403413033e-09,9.57157920199497e-13,3.55404909178666e-14,1.25924859695459e-25,3.71485658738486e-69,3.54632831649428e-154,3.57989298204008e-298,0,0,0,2.45967881658921e-33,3.99378181295095e-23,3.09245571243379e-13,1.00540389026062e-11,1.68655876155387e-15,1.02205915473133e-17,2.27807965008685e-31,2.38163707509037e-78,7.05310576455764e-170,0,0,0,0]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 36 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 92.5% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.6, theta0=-5).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-5.25,-5,-4.75,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-5.25,-5,-4.75,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-5.25,-5,-4.75,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-5.25,-5,-4.75,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[2674.82207206225,2675.09734206437,2634.80499005936,2578.97603518006,2474.14614100113,2358.82260515841,2209.23712681542,2006.49279887267,1884.86687606356,2681.73357052238,2690.13639005313,2658.86458343898,2615.72895832742,2523.80767196071,2420.29937745571,2264.59154074016,2017.90709401764,1891.31371399718,2683.39802062905,2695.21505141754,2675.45314177268,2639.34628208715,2557.72507319707,2452.28467615403,2307.66634161512,2137.92780755811,1892.80586017919,2685.25217222722,2700.82532822801,2683.17679679766,2655.65150223619,2582.25655364325,2483.42396719292,2342.32413596029,2167.93197430199,1891.8888420095],[2674.2324839121,2661.05537091489,2637.16448850225,2568.54901638772,2488.11169883858,2366.71894505639,2238.15274723724,1999.1667506372,1893.49790578759,2679.94920746029,2676.89567730603,2658.86458337045,2605.88273963701,2537.63238234645,2423.76091480634,2284.22922700211,2011.09325017615,1886.15400571749,2685.25791926547,2684.86138318897,2673.50408052937,2629.89447886724,2571.44717838293,2465.38216618469,2327.15739901466,2133.97089172576,1887.7154679547,2685.25217217872,2689.01110418203,2684.9932449248,2655.65150206774,2595.90168492079,2497.09021024531,2361.62346039318,2163.97329112171,1886.83497546337],[5.07379286783198e-12,6.68160775316411e-12,2.11901893715678e-29,1.20206458823259e-53,3.57176784333653e-99,2.94108768678962e-149,3.1941856606498e-214,2.84195562847681e-302,0,5.09282058351529e-09,2.27120602281956e-05,5.95776651936066e-19,1.10032130003323e-37,1.32011595989706e-77,1.47072321218008e-122,3.50329470124205e-190,2.57503234904383e-297,0,2.69041870225238e-08,0.00364662527027843,9.53680332918804e-12,1.98789255081683e-27,7.09173141245864e-63,1.1443784569798e-108,1.78494566857372e-171,3.42859584097834e-245,0,1.71817612897123e-07,0.996330437268872,2.15647081068991e-08,2.39695589685228e-20,3.19623622806003e-52,3.8211311343413e-95,2.01054519635393e-156,3.67925886496194e-232,0],[3.53222359163715e-07,6.68806868777662e-13,2.81593305049507e-23,4.46993710756167e-53,5.20976653737819e-88,9.92236391483908e-141,1.44885485073014e-196,2.3481471201291e-300,0,0.000107346942302539,5.06592063991849e-06,7.47917651679987e-14,7.31360344777567e-37,1.67254514684201e-66,5.88339287977805e-116,1.48520289311207e-176,3.5508983635173e-295,0,0.0216937145533879,0.0145921905266863,1.70493025297807e-07,1.96018588357482e-26,8.1088109399236e-52,7.00660531338998e-98,6.53512666828477e-158,8.23038054635239e-242,0,0.021569396469628,0.925382793979738,0.0166489678914866,3.00905623039616e-15,3.38387585694179e-41,4.13177079510643e-84,6.07679071416158e-143,8.81650417642513e-229,0]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?

["waist2015-1.html", "10.1 GSEA Round 1", " 10.1 GSEA Round 1 Last updated: 2016-05-03 Code version: 2b47376ddf7e38c117d4b4449c638c34e8ca3a48  10.1.1 Fit the null model I used the grids theta0=(-5.25:0.25:-2)' and h=(0.3:0.1:0.6)' when fitting the null model. I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 56 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 100% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-3).

I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 56 sets of (h,theta0) under null.  After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (logw.step*) to posterior probabilities (posp.step*), we can see that almost 100% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting (h=0.3, theta0=-4).  {\"x\":{\"data\":[[-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2,-4.5,-4.25,-4,-3.75,-3.5,-3.25,-3,-2.75,-2.5,-2.25,-2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],[80.5062321864266,84.5727990857088,83.408716267486,74.949034387681,55.2447680284808,20.0238531860557,-45.0615009890781,-144.224511523699,-309.049655343748,-571.188890945735,-981.764599170632,75.9254811037258,81.2261179413314,74.4681742954361,59.6213383434421,29.0203297263182,-26.5105159708836,-124.067585196637,-276.249735026721,-525.701019098632,-917.830627785682,-1527.96568704349,72.5393393064316,75.0139336497721,68.7900663644776,47.8356121628789,8.57766574658151,-60.8134881958563,-181.939717824548,-376.684168232863,-696.056814757022,-1178.85894681107,-1966.90068447453,69.8762927332316,71.1557185655993,62.9595912242255,38.6963181484589,-6.78007378558731,-85.0607897847444,-227.363777664083,-454.174311943248,-835.188264502827,-1407.12260067716,-2341.79936696936],[82.3186739448078,84.5769945043861,85.4146124722247,75.6555007538518,56.29003125972,20.0238531855075,-44.6213684847041,-146.240994683116,-311.03703257267,-573.044812406878,-981.764599170529,77.6440763839093,77.9426496799366,75.2986894217372,59.6213383433929,31.5277806126862,-26.5105159709535,-124.067585196697,-278.276283935585,-525.701019100556,-923.300589570904,-1527.96568704463,74.1843544618215,73.0336283028815,68.7983905628065,47.835612162814,11.0856796346392,-60.8134881961842,-181.109095191548,-378.716726920285,-694.040473895618,-1182.39423094774,-1969.04945872648,69.0488542784563,70.2327562917579,62.9597797034909,41.6921011446138,-2.89443272925714,-85.0607897843893,-226.525849439737,-457.07939112088,-836.829487163308,-1407.12260067684,-2341.68361830109],[0.0125547861435008,0.732650556880486,0.228740012031407,4.84561584247358e-05,1.34243983517823e-13,6.78650021452597e-29,3.67650953101459e-57,3.15854749734979e-100,8.25727925048627e-172,1.17818492025099e-285,0,0.000128651365813015,0.0257900230537903,2.99580882605124e-05,1.06810800089641e-11,5.4798161145227e-25,4.18818756922418e-49,1.79278945083814e-91,1.45097982097495e-157,6.70417275148854e-266,0,0,4.35343138325501e-06,5.17052178120611e-05,1.02457358246042e-07,8.13091316167223e-17,7.25487315125335e-34,5.30193712596608e-64,1.31820037780683e-116,3.4957570176728e-201,0,0,0,3.0358846892631e-07,1.09127159482398e-06,3.00884609359096e-10,8.7296003930981e-21,1.55184481691099e-40,1.56302272440204e-74,2.46923769275806e-136,7.76246085052491e-235,0,0,0],[0.0305815480763487,0.292573928754655,0.67609618434418,3.90553125194085e-05,1.5183209222939e-13,2.69874940286207e-29,2.27038498766601e-57,1.67207824117728e-101,4.50035424391136e-173,7.32341596979524e-287,0,0.000285303789636993,0.000384570773046517,2.73349903398646e-05,4.24748506583742e-12,2.674574878494e-24,1.66549301549147e-49,7.12928506494354e-92,7.604296752569e-159,2.66601069961494e-266,0,0,8.96952409099932e-06,2.83801952935361e-06,4.1084215596939e-08,3.2333745460474e-17,3.54293437293446e-33,2.10839154255676e-64,1.20290948729857e-116,1.82107951208445e-202,0,0,0,5.27776451976212e-08,1.72429719101359e-07,1.19673645692165e-10,6.94325443763878e-20,3.00522817461895e-39,6.21558463804624e-75,2.2697979227157e-136,1.68988152843837e-236,0,0,0]],\"container\":\"\\n  \\n    \\n      theta0\\u003c/th>\\n      h\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      logw.step2\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step1\\u003c/th>\\n      posp.step2\\u003c/th>\\n    \\u003c/tr>\\n  \\u003c/thead>\\n\\u003c/table>\",\"options\":{\"keys\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2,3,4,5]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data) {\\nvar d = parseFloat(data[4]); $(this.api().cell(row, 4).node()).html(isNaN(d) ?
