<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.1</span> Fit the null model</h3>
<p>I used the grids <code>theta0=(-5.25:0.25:-3.25)'</code> and <code>h=(0.3:0.1:0.6)'</code> when fitting the null model. I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 36 sets of <code>(h,theta0)</code> under null.</p>
<p><img src="images/load2013_null_round1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (<code>logw.step*</code>) to posterior probabilities (<code>posp.step*</code>), we can see that almost 92.5% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting <code>(h=0.6, theta0=-5)</code>.</p>

<p>To perform GSEA, I set <code>(h=0.6, theta0=-5)</code>, since the null analysis suggests that almost 92.5% posterior mass is placed on this setting. For the log-fold enrichment parameter, I use the grid <code>theta=(0:0.025:5)'</code>. The following table lists the GSEA results.</p>
