<h3><span class="header-section-number">27.1.1</span> Fit the null model</h3>
<p>I used the grids <code>theta0=(-5:0.25:-2)'</code> and <code>h=(0.3:0.1:0.6)'</code> when fitting the null model. I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 52 sets of <code>(h,theta0)</code> under null.</p>
<p><img src="images/mcv2012_null_round1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (<code>logw.step*</code>) to posterior probabilities (<code>posp.step*</code>), we can see that almost 100% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting <code>h=0.6</code> and <code>theta0=-4</code>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">27.1.2</span> Fit the enrichment model</h3>
<p>To perform GSEA, I set <code>h=0.6</code> and <code>theta0=-4</code>, since the null analysis suggests that almost 100% posterior mass is placed on these settings. For the log-fold enrichment parameter, I use the grid <code>theta = (0:(4/200):4)'</code>. The following table lists the GSEA results.</p>
