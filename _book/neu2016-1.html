<p>I used the grids <code>theta0=(-4.5:0.25:-2)'</code> and <code>h=(0.3:0.1:0.6)'</code> when fitting the null model. I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 44 sets of <code>(h,theta0)</code> under null.</p>
<p><img src="images/neu2016_null_round1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (<code>logw.step*</code>) to posterior probabilities (<code>posp.step*</code>), we can see that almost 100% posterior mass is concentrated on the settings <code>h=[0.3 0.4]</code> and <code>theta0=[-4 -4.25 -4.5]</code>.</p>

<p>To perform GSEA, I use a smaller grid that includes <code>h=[0.3 0.4]</code> and <code>theta0=[-4 -4.25 -4.5]</code>, since the null analysis suggests that almost 100% posterior mass is placed on thses settings. For the log-fold enrichment parameter, I use the grid <code>theta  = (0:0.1:4)'</code>. The following table lists the GSEA results.</p>
