<p>I used the grids <code>theta0=(-5.25:0.25:-2)'</code> and <code>h=(0.3:0.1:0.6)'</code> when fitting the null model. I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 56 sets of <code>(h,theta0)</code> under null.</p>
<p><img src="images/waist2015_null_round1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (<code>logw.step*</code>) to posterior probabilities (<code>posp.step*</code>), we can see that almost 100% posterior mass is concentrated on the setting <code>(h=0.3, theta0=-3)</code>.</p>

<p>To help decide the grid for <code>theta</code> in Round 2 enrichment analysis (Section <a href="waist2015-2.html#waist2015-2">10.2</a>), I visualized the posterior mean, 95% lower and upper bound of <code>theta</code> for the top 100 enriched pathways identified in Round 1 analysis.</p>
