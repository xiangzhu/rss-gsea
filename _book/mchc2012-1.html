<p>I used the grids <code>theta0=(-6:0.25:-3)'</code> and <code>h=(0.3:0.1:0.6)'</code> when fitting the null model. I estimated the (unnormalized) log importance weights (“pseudo-likelihoods”) for all 52 sets of <code>(h,theta0)</code> under null.</p>
<p><img src="images/mchc2012_null_round1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>After normalizing the log “pseudo-likelihoods” (<code>logw.step*</code>) to posterior probabilities (<code>posp.step*</code>), we can see that almost 98.8% posterior mass is concentrated on the settings <code>h=[0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6]</code> and <code>theta0 = (-6:0.25:-5.25)</code>.</p>
