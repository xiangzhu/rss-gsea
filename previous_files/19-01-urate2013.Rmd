# Serum Urate 2013 {#urate2013}

**Last updated:** `r Sys.Date()`

**Code version:** `r system("git log -1 --format='%H'", intern = TRUE)`

The GWAS summary statistics corresponding to @urate_ng_2013 are provided by the [Global Urate Genetics Consortium (GUGC)](http://metabolomics.helmholtz-muenchen.de/gugc/).

Below is the basic information about these datasets (excerpt from the `README` of GUGC data).

```
1. GUGC_MetaAnalysis_Results_UA.csv

This file contains the summary statistics for association with serum urate concentrations from meta-analysis of up to 110,347 individuals from 48 studies. 
It has the following headers:
MarkerName: rs identifier of the SNP
n_total: number of individuals with available SNP information
A1: the modeled allele, i.e. the allele to which the beta estimate refers to
A2: the other allele
beta: effect of each additional copy of A1 on serum urate concentrations in mg/dl
se: standard error of the beta
p_gc: genomic control corrected p-value for association

2.  GUGC_MetaAnalysis_Results_Gout.csv

This file contains the summary statistics for association with gout from meta-analysis of up to 2,115 gout cases and 67,259 controls from 14 studies. 
It has the following headers:
MarkerName: rs identifier of the SNP
n_total: number of individuals with available SNP information
A1: the modeled allele, i.e. the allele to which the beta estimate refers to
A2: the other allele
beta: log odds of each additional copy of A1. To obtain the odds ratio for gout per allele, exponentiate the beta. OR = exp(beta)
se: standard error of the beta
p_gc: genomic control corrected p-value for association
